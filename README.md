Interactive map of the Bulgarian VHF and UHF amateur radio repeaters based on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) and [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster).

## Notes

This project uses an [external JSON database](https://varna.radio/reps.json) with the repeaters data.
There is also a JavaScript library for working with the JSON database *(see src/reps.js)*.

No changes to the repeaters data should come to this repository! Instead, please use the contact methods described on the website.

That being said, PRs with code improvements, moderate refactoring or new features are welcome.
